        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          The Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at Chittagong
          University of Engineering and Technology (CUET), established in 1984,
          is the pioneer of computer science and engineering education in
          Bangladesh. As the first department of its kind in the country, CSE
          CUET has consistently set the standard for excellence in education,
          research, and innovation, and has been widely recognized on domestic
          and global stages. Since its establishment, the department has been
          attracting the best and the brightest students of the country. The
          department offers Bachelor's, Master's, and Ph.D. degrees in Computer
          Science and Engineering, and regularly updates the curriculum to
          maintain international standards. It is also offering specialized
          postgraduate programs (Master's and Ph.D.) in Artificial Intelligence
          and Machine Learning (AI & ML), Data Science, Cyber Security, Software
          Engineering, and Computing to nurture the next generation of leaders
          and innovators in these rapidly evolving fields. The recent expansion
          in this front is supported by the Ministry of Education (Bangladesh)
          and funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The world-class
          education and research activities here are designed to equip students
          with the knowledge, skills, and mindset needed to thrive in today's
          and tomorrow’s dynamic tech landscape. With a highly competitive
          environment, state-of-the-art facilities, and a team of dedicated
          faculty members and staff, it is ensured that students reach their
          full potential and emerge as trailblazers in their chosen field.
          Currently, the department hosts about 700 undergraduate students and
          400 graduate students, all of whom are driven by a shared passion for
          excellence and a commitment to making a difference in the world. The
          students have participated and secured commendable positions in the
          International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) world finals
          regularly in the last three decades, and became Asia West Champions in
          2021 and 2023. The research outcomes of undergraduate and
          post-graduate students are regularly published in prestigious journals
          and conferences, and students have received numerous awards including
          many best paper awards. Students of the department regularly get
          admitted to top ranked universities including MIT, UC Berkeley, CMU,
          etc., for postgraduate degrees, which is a testament to the excellence
          of the students and the quality of education at the department.
